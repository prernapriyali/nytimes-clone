          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
                Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                far beyond the world of known physics.
                <br /><br />
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
                discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
                force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
                for a prodigiously violent instant.
                <br /><br />
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
                heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
                mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
                beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                <br /><br />
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
                and drew a double box around it.
                <br /><br />
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
                that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
                hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                <br /><br />
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
                time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
                John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
                waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
                when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
                correct.
                <br /><br />
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
                many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                <br /><br />
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
                comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
                apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
                and space and energy to science and speculation.
                <br /><br />
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
                billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
                galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
                universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
                into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                <br /><br />
                <span class="emphasis">‘As Big as It Gets’</span>
                <br /><br />
      
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
                accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
                Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
                waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
                should ruffle space-time.
                <br /><br />
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it
                gets.”
                <br /><br />
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                <br /><br />
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
                of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
                the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
                of the sun.
                <br /><br />
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
                Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
                reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
                Astrophysical Journal.

        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only</br> one in 10 million.

        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had </br>
        not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
        Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team <br>
“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’</br> 
worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select</br>
 few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who</br>
  was sleeping that night in 1979),
<br> in his office last week.“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he </br> 
tended his radio telescopes.
Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the </br>most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in </br>
1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when </br> Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s </br>
brteam, </br>knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

          Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
          anything.
          <br /><br />
          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a
          delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply
          forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in
          an email.
          <br /><br />
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
          was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of
          spoiling a vacation,” he said.
          <br /><br />
          By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
          inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
          with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
          <br /><br />
          Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that
          if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries
          in the history of science.”
          <br /><br />
          John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and
          head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
          pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
          beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
          <br /><br />
          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
          that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
          said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
          expressed reservations about inflation.
          <br /><br />
          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
          need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
          estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
          European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about
          the universe.
          <br /><br />
          “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
          Krauss said.
          <br /><br />
          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
          report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are
          trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

          <span class="emphasis">Spirals in the Sky</span>
          <br /><br />
          Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
          cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
          and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
          <br /><br />
          Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
          waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series
          of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
          the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are
          Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
          California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
          <br /><br />
          “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
          the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
          wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
